This project is a movie recommendation system model built from the MovieLens 10M Dataset.
The data set is divided into a training set and a test set.
The training set is then explored to find patterns in the variables, which are then used to build a prediction model.
Once the final algorithm is established, the model is tested on the test set, and the model performance is examined.
